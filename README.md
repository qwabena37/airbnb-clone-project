üöÄProject Airbnb Brief Summary 

    The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust
    booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, 
    database design, API development, and application security.This backend will support various functionalities required 
    to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts leveraging on a high-level 
    Python web framework like Django and CI/CD Pipelines for automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

üèÜ Project Goals

    User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
    Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
    Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
    Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
    Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
    Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

    Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
    Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
    PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
    GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
    Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
    Redis: Used for caching and session management.
    Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.

Database Design

    Users 
    a user can have multiple properties
    users can edit their profiles
    users are authenticated from the database
    Properties
    a booking belongs to a property
    a user can select from the available properties
    a selected property can be deselected  
    Bookings
    a user can create a booking 
    bookings can be reviewed
    a booking must contain at least one of the properties displayed
    Bookings can be updated from the profile
    Reviews 
    Reviews must posted for the respective property
    Reviews for properties must be checked and cleaned regularly
    A review must be posted for each property displayed 
    Payments
    Payments related to bookings must be handled individually
    Users must have placeholders for payment
    Payment for each property must be shown in the bookings

    API Documentation
    The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
    Django REST Framework provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
    GraphQL offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
    Data Optimization 
    Ensure efficient data retrieval
    Enable save storage of user and property data. 
    Enhance database optimizations.
    
  API Security
  
    Authentication: this ensures that users are completely verified before giving access to data from the system. 
    Authorization: this features declares and defines the data that can be accessed and modified by the user.
    Rate limiting: this system defines and manages the ratings a user to create for a property.
    Protecting user data: security is essential in protecting user data to prevent unauthorize access and 
    modification to user data. 
    Securing payments: security features to secure payments deny intruders from having access to payment systems.
  
  CI/CD Pipeline
  
    A CI/CD pipeline is an automated process that streamlines software development by integrating, testing and 
    deploying code changes continuously.CI stands for Continuous Integration whereas CD stands for Continuous 
    Delivery/Deployment. It aims to release software updates faster and more reliably. Some CI/CD Pipelines include
    GitHub Actions, Docker, GitLab, CircleCI, Jenkins, TeamCity, Azure DevOps Server etc
